I subdued at my feet the kings, their leaders, and imposed (upon them) corvée. With my surpassingly strong might I frequently traversed impassable rocky mountains the paths of which no other king knew. Forty kings of the lands Nairi fiercely took up a position for armed conflict. I fought with them (and) brought about their defeat. I caused their blood to flow into the caves and ravines of the mountains. (Thus) I became lord of all their lands and levied upon them tribute and impost forever.	At the beginning of my sovereignty (lit. at the beginning of the throne of my sovereignty), at the beginning of my reign, I uprooted 28,800 Hittite people from Syria (lit. “Beyond the Euphrates”) and led (them) into my land... I conquered the lands of the Papḫu (and) Uqumanu as far as the lands Šarnida (and) Meḫru. Annually I regularly received the tribute of their lands and the produce of their mountains. (As) with a bridle I controlled the lands Katmuḫu, Buššu, Alzu, Madanu, Niḫanu, Alaia, Tepurzu, Purulumzu, (and) the entire land of the extensive Šubaru. I subdued at my feet the kings, their leaders, and imposed (upon them) corvée. With my surpassingly strong might I frequently traversed mighty mountains (and) extremely difficult ranges, the paths of which no other king knew. I cut into their mountains with copper picks (and) widened their impassable paths. I did battle with forty kings of the lands Nairi (and) brought about the defeat of their army. (Thus) I became lord of all their lands. I fastened bronze clasps to the necks of those same kings of the lands Nairi (and) brought them to Ekur, the great mountain, the temple of my support, into the presence of the god Aššur, my lord. I made them swear by the great gods of heaven (and) underworld (and) levied upon them tribute and impost forever.

... s, drainage pipes	Furiouly, I overwhelmed the region around that district like a fog and compacted the length and breadth (of it) like ice. In a lordly manner, I entered the city Ulḫu, the city where Ursâ (Rusâ) went for relaxation, and walked about triumphantly in the palace (that had been) his (own) royal abode. With iron axes and iron spades, I smashed its strong (city) wall, which had been built with (blocks of) massive mountain stone, as if (it were) a pot, and leveled (it) down to the ground. I tore out the lengthy beams of juniper (that formed) the roof of his palace, cut (them) up with pickaxes, and took (them back) to Assyria. I opened up his granaries (and) storehouses and (then) fed my army his abundant grain in unlimited quantities. (220) I entered his hidden wine cellars, and the extensive troops of the god Aššur drew sweet wine (to drink) from waterskins (and) leather buckets as if (it were) river water. I blocked up the outlet of the canal, the canal on which he relied (to provide water), and turned the abundant water (supply) into a swamp. I stopped up the irrigation ditches (and) drainage pipes that forked off from its (the canal’s) center, and exposed ... their pebbles to the sun. I had my fierce warriors enter his well-kept gardens, (which provide) the general impression of his city (and) which were (so) studded with fruit trees and grapevines that they dripped (fruit as abundantly) as a rainfall, and they (the warriors) made the noise of (their) iron pickaxes resound like (the thunder of) the god Adad. (225) They picked a great deal of its fruit, a countless amount, and did not leave (any) for the weary heart to smile about in the future. I (cut down and) spread out his large trees, the ornaments of his palace, like malt (spread out for drying); I made his famous city disgusting and its district a subject of revilement. I gathered up those logs — all the trees that I had chopped down —, piled (them) up in heaps, and set them on fire. I tore out by the roots their abundant crops, which are as countless as reeds in a canebrake, and did not leave even a (single) ear of barley to allow the identification of what had been destroyed. (With regard to) his well-kept field(s) that were spotted with colored flecks like polished lapis lazuli and (whose) meadowland(s) were planted with new vegetation and young shoots, (230) like the god Adad, I trampled (it) down with (my) chariotry, (my) cavalry, (and) the passage of my infantry, and I turned the meadows that his horses had relied on (for pasture) into wasteland.
