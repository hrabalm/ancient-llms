A letter from Aššur-reṣuwa came to me in which it was written that a messenger of the (king) of Ukku has gone to Urarṭu and that he has sent a letter about it to the Palace.	Natnu, the king of the land of the Nabayateans — whose location is remote — heard about the might of the gods Aššur (and) Marduk, who had encouraged me. The one who had never sent his messenger to the kings, my ancestors, (and) (viii 50) had never inquired about the well-being of their royal majesties, he now sent to me his messenger with greetings and kissed my feet. He was constantly beseeching my lordly majesty to conclude a treaty (and) peace agreement, (and) to do obeisance to me. I myself looked with pleasure upon him and turned my benevolent face towards him. I imposed upon him annual tribute payment.

Moving on from this camp I marched to the cities in the plain of Mount Niṣir which no one had ever seen. I conquered the city Larbusa, the fortified city (iii 5) which (was ruled by) Kirteara, (and) eight cities in its environs. The troops were frightened (and) took to a rugged mountain. The mountain was as jagged as the point of a dagger. The king with his troops climbed up after them. I threw down their corpses within the mountain, massacred 172 of their fighting men, (iii 10) (and) piled up many troops on the precipices of the mountain. I brought back captives, possessions, oxen, (and) sheep from them (and) burnt their cities. I hung their heads on trees of the mountain (and) burnt their adolescent boys. I returned to my camp (and) spent the night.	In the eponymy of Miqti-adur I was in Nineveh (and) a report was brought back to me saying Ameka (and) Araštua had withheld the tribute (and) corvée of Aššur, my lord.

Without waiting for the advance of (my) numerous chariotry and troops I moved on from the city Kalzi, crossed the Lower Zab, (and) entered the passes of Mount Babitu. I crossed the River Radānu (and) (iii 35) all day I tarried at the foot of Mount Simaki. I received the tribute of the land Dagara, oxen, sheep, (and) wine. From the foot of Mount Simaki I took with me strong chariots, cavalry, (and) crack troops. I continued travelling through the night until dawn, crossed the River Turnat, and at first light approached the city Mamli, the fortified city (iii 40) which (was ruled by) Araštua. In a clash of arms I besieged the city (and) conquered (it). I felled with the sword 800 of their combat troops. With their corpses I filled the streets of their city (and) with their blood I dyed their houses red. Many troops I captured alive (and) (iii 45) carried off many captives from them. I razed, destroyed, (and) burnt the city. I conquered the city Ḫudun (and) 30 cities in its environs. I massacred many of them (and) carried off captives, oxen, (and) sheep from them. I razed, destroyed, (and) burnt their cities. (iii 50) I burnt their adolescent boys  (and) girls.

If the king has written to his army: "Invade Mannea," the whole army should not invade; (only) the cavalry and the professional troops should invade. The Cimmerians who said, "The Manneans are at your disposal, we shall keep aloof" — maybe it was a lie; they are barbarians who recognize no oath sworn by god and no treaty.	The chariots and wagons should stay side by side in the pass, while the cavalry and the professionals should invade and plunder the countryside of Mannea and come back and take up position in the pass. If, after they have repeatedly entered and plundered the open country, the Cimmerians have not advanced against them, the whole army can enter and throw itself against the cities of Mannea.
