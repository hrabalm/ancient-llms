... s, drainage pipes	Furiouly, I overwhelmed the region around that district like a fog and compacted the length and breadth (of it) like ice. In a lordly manner, I entered the city Ulḫu, the city where Ursâ (Rusâ) went for relaxation, and walked about triumphantly in the palace (that had been) his (own) royal abode. With iron axes and iron spades, I smashed its strong (city) wall, which had been built with (blocks of) massive mountain stone, as if (it were) a pot, and leveled (it) down to the ground. I tore out the lengthy beams of juniper (that formed) the roof of his palace, cut (them) up with pickaxes, and took (them back) to Assyria. I opened up his granaries (and) storehouses and (then) fed my army his abundant grain in unlimited quantities. (220) I entered his hidden wine cellars, and the extensive troops of the god Aššur drew sweet wine (to drink) from waterskins (and) leather buckets as if (it were) river water.

(225) They picked a great deal of its fruit, a countless amount, and did not leave (any) for the weary heart to smile about in the future. I (cut down and) spread out his large trees, the ornaments of his palace, like malt (spread out for drying); I made his famous city disgusting and its district a subject of revilement. I gathered up those logs — all the trees that I had chopped down —, piled (them) up in heaps, and set them on fire. I tore out by the roots their abundant crops, which are as countless as reeds in a canebrake, and did not leave even a (single) ear of barley to allow the identification of what had been destroyed. (With regard to) his well-kept field(s) that were spotted with colored flecks like polished lapis lazuli and (whose) meadowland(s) were planted with new vegetation and young shoots, (230) like the god Adad, I trampled (it) down with (my) chariotry, (my) cavalry, (and) the passage of my infantry, and I turned the meadows that his horses had relied on (for pasture) into wasteland. (With regard to) the city Sarduriḫurda, their large fortress, together with fifty-seven settlements in the environs of the district Sangibutu, I destroyed all of them, leveling (them) down to the ground.
