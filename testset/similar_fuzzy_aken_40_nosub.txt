In my fifth regnal year I moved out from Nineveh and ascended Mount Kašiyari. I captured eleven fortified cities (and) confined Anḫitti the Šubraean to his city (and) received his tribute. ii 19-33) In my sixth regnal year I moved out from Nineveh and approached the cities on the banks of the River Baliḫ (Paliḫ). They became frightened in the face of my mighty weapons and killed Giammu, their city ruler. I entered the city Tīl-turaḫi (and) claimed the city as my own. Moving on from the banks of the River Baliḫ (Paliḫ) I crossed the Euphrates in flood. I received tribute from the kings of the land Ḫatti. (ii 25) Moving on from the land Ḫatti I approached the city Aleppo (Ḫalman) (and) made sacrifices before the god Adad of Aleppo (Ḫalman). Moving on from Aleppo (Ḫalman) I approached the city Qarqar. Hadad-ezer (Adad-idri), the Damascene, (and) Irḫulēnu, the Ḫamatite, together with twelve kings on the shore of the sea, trusting in their united forces, (ii 30) attacked me to wage war and battle. I fought with them. I put to the sword 25,000 of their fighting men (and) captured from them their chariotry, cavalry, (and) military equipment. To save their lives they ran away. I boarded boats (and) went out upon the sea.	On my third campaign, I marched against Baʾalu, the king of the land Tyre who resides in the middle of the sea. Because he did not honor my royal command(s and) did not obey the pronouncement(s) from my lip(s), (iii 20') I set up outposts against him. To prevent his people from leaving, I reinforced (its) garrison. By sea and dry land, I took control of (all of) his routes (and thus) cut off (all) access to him. (iii 25') I made water and food for the preservation of their lives scarce for their mouths. I confined them in a harsh imprisonment from which there was no escape. I constricted (and) cut short their lives. I made them (the people of Tyre) bow down to my yoke.
