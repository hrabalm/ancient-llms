On my third campaign, I marched against Baʾalu, the king of the land Tyre who resides in the middle of the sea. Because he did not honor my royal command(s and) did not obey the pronouncement(s) from my lip(s), (iii 20') I set up outposts against him. To prevent his people from leaving, I reinforced (its) garrison. By sea and dry land, I took control of (all of) his routes (and thus) cut off (all) access to him. (iii 25') I made water and food for the preservation of their lives scarce for their mouths. I confined them in a harsh imprisonment from which there was no escape. I constricted (and) cut short their lives. I made them (the people of Tyre) bow down to my yoke.
With regard to the city Urraṭinaš, their stronghold situated in the land Panaru, the terror, fear, (and) splendor of the god Aššur, my lord, overwhelmed them. To save (ii 40) their lives they took their gods (and) possessions and flew like birds to ledges on high mountains. Taking my chariotry and army I crossed the Tigris. Šadi-Tešub, son of Ḫattuḫu, king (ii 45) of the city Urraṭinaš, submitted to me in his own land. I took his natural sons and his family as hostages. He brought to me as tribute and tax 60 copper kettles, bronze vats, (ii 50) and large bronze bath-tubs, together with 120 men, cattle, and sheep. I accepted his (tribute), spared him (and) preserved his life. (ii 55) I imposed upon him forever the heavy yoke of my dominion. I completely conquered the extensive land Katmuḫu and subdued it.	(As for) the citizens of (the cities) Sippar, Nippur, Babylon, (and) Borsippa who through no fault of their own had been held captive in them, I put an end to their imprisonment and let them see the light (of day). (With regard to) their fields, which long ago, while the land was in disorder, the Sutians had taken away and appropriated for their own — I struck down (those) Sutians, the people of the steppe, with the sword. I restored to their former status their territories, (whose boundaries) had been forgotten (and) fallen into disuse during the troubled period in the land. I (re)-established the freedom (from obligations) of (the cities) Ur, Uruk, Eridu, Larsa, Kullaba, Kissik, (and) Nēmed-Laguda. Moreover, I returned their gods that had been carried off as booty to their cult centers and I restored their regular offerings that had been discontinued.

I turned around (lit. “I turned the front of my yoke”) and took the road to the land Bīt-Yakīn. He — Marduk-apla-iddina (II) (Merodach-baladan), whom (iii 60) I had defeated and whose forces I had scattered during my first campaign — became frightened by the clangor of my mighty weapons and my fierce battle array, then dislodged the gods of the (full) extent of his land from their abodes, and loaded (them) onto boats. (iii 65) He flew away like a bird to the city Nagīte-raqqi, which is in the midst of the sea. I brought his brothers, the seed of his father’s house, whom he had abandoned at the shore of the sea, together with the rest of the people of his land, out of the land Bīt-Yakīn, which is in the swamps and marshes, and I counted (them) as booty.	(As for) the citizens of (the cities) Sippar, Nippur, Babylon, (and) Borsippa who through no fault of their own had been held captive in them, I put an end to their imprisonment and let them see the light (of day). (With regard to) their fields, which long ago, while the land was in disorder, the Sutians had taken away and appropriated for their own — I struck down (those) Sutians, the people of the steppe, with the sword. I restored to their former status their territories, (whose boundaries) had been forgotten (and) fallen into disuse during the troubled period in the land. I (re)-established the freedom (from obligations) of (the cities) Ur, Uruk, Eridu, Larsa, Kullaba, Kissik, (and) Nēmed-Laguda. Moreover, I returned their gods that had been carried off as booty to their cult centers and I restored their regular offerings that had been discontinued.

In my fifth regnal year I moved out from Nineveh and ascended Mount Kašiyari. I captured eleven fortified cities (and) confined Anḫitti the Šubraean to his city (and) received his tribute. ii 19-33) In my sixth regnal year I moved out from Nineveh and approached the cities on the banks of the River Baliḫ (Paliḫ). They became frightened in the face of my mighty weapons and killed Giammu, their city ruler. I entered the city Tīl-turaḫi (and) claimed the city as my own. Moving on from the banks of the River Baliḫ (Paliḫ) I crossed the Euphrates in flood. I received tribute from the kings of the land Ḫatti. (ii 25) Moving on from the land Ḫatti I approached the city Aleppo (Ḫalman) (and) made sacrifices before the god Adad of Aleppo (Ḫalman). Moving on from Aleppo (Ḫalman) I approached the city Qarqar. Hadad-ezer (Adad-idri), the Damascene, (and) Irḫulēnu, the Ḫamatite, together with twelve kings on the shore of the sea, trusting in their united forces, (ii 30) attacked me to wage war and battle. I fought with them. I put to the sword 25,000 of their fighting men (and) captured from them their chariotry, cavalry, (and) military equipment. To save their lives they ran away. I boarded boats (and) went out upon the sea.

I marched about through the lands of Urarṭu, Zikirtu, Mannea, Naʾiri, and Muṣaṣir (420) in a lordly manner, like a fierce lion that is endowed with fearsomeness, and I met no one who could overpower (me). On the battlefield, I stuck down the large army of Ursâ (Rusâ), the Urarṭian, (and) of Mitatti of the land Zikirtu. I conquered in all 430 settlements in seven districts belonging to Ursâ (Rusâ), the Urarṭian, and I laid waste to his land. I carried off as booty from Urzana of the city Muṣaṣir, his god Ḫaldi (and) his goddess Bagbartu, together with abundant property from his temple, (along) with 6,110 people, 12 kūdanu-mules, 380 donkeys, 525 oxen, 1,285 sheep and goats, his wife, his sons, (and) his daughters.
